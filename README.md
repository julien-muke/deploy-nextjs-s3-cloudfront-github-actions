## <a name="steps">☑️ Steps</a>

* Create a Create NextJS App
* Push Source Code to GitHub
* Create S3 Bucket
* Setting permissions for website access
* Create CloudFront Distribution
* Integrate AWS with Github for Github Actions Workflow
* Set up IAM roles to connect GitHub Actions to actions in AWS
* Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services


## ➡️ Step 1 - Create and configure a Next.js 13 app

To create a new Next.js application, Run this command:

```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
```

Once you created the application, navigate to the project directory and open your project with a code editor (VS code). You can create more files within your application.

For me, i've a Modern UI/UX website using React.js & Tailwind CSS called KivuBank.

Note: If you want a website example, i have a few React.js apps in my ![GitHub repo](https://github.com/julien-muke) that you can clone into your local machine and use for this AWS demo.

Feel free to follow and give it a star ⭐


## ➡️ Step 2 - Push your Next.js 14 app to GitHub

When you're done building your Next.js application, You have to push your code to GitHub.
Create a GitHub repository and push your Next.js app's code to this repository by using the following command:


```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin <your_repository_url>
git push -u -f origin master
```

## ➡️ Step 3 - Create S3 Bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose Buckets.
3. Choose Create bucket
