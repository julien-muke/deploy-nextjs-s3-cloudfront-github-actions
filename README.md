## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

* Create a Create NextJS App
* Push Source Code to GitHub
* Create S3 Bucket
* Setting permissions for website access
* Create CloudFront Distribution
* Integrate AWS with Github for Github Actions Workflow
* Set up IAM roles to connect GitHub Actions to actions in AWS
* Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create and configure a Next.js 13 app

To create a new Next.js application, Run this command:

```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
```

Once you created the application, navigate to the project directory and open your project with a code editor (VS code). You can create more files within your application.

For me, i've a Modern UI/UX website using React.js & Tailwind CSS called KivuBank.

Note: If you want a website example, i have a few React.js apps in my ![GitHub repo](https://github.com/julien-muke) that you can clone into your local machine and use for this AWS demo (Feel free to follow and give it a star ‚≠ê).


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Push your Next.js 14 app to¬†GitHub

When you're done building your Next.js application, You have to push your code to GitHub.
Create a GitHub repository and push your Next.js app's code to this repository by using the following command:


```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin <your_repository_url>
git push -u -f origin master
```

## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 3 - Create S3 Bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose Buckets.
3. Choose Create bucket
4. Under Bucket type, choose General purpose.
5. For Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket. I will name it `nextjs-s3-cloudfront-jm`

6. Clear Block all public access, leave the rest as default and choose Save changes.

Public access is granted to buckets and objects through access control lists (ACLs), bucket policies, access point policies, or all. In order to ensure that public access to this bucket and its objects is blocked, turn on Block all public access.

7. Next, let's navigate to Tab, choose "properties", scroll down to "static website hosting", click "Edit"

8. To edit static website hosting:
    <br>* "Enable" Static website hosting

    <br>* Specify the home or default page of the website as `index.html`
